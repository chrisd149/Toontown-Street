# Toontown Street

This is a DNA file of a Toontown Street using Toontown Central assets.  This is for anyone who needs a street that is mostly complete, with building names and suit paths not setup for better customization.

The original intention for this street was to serve as a test area for a Toontown minigame I was working on back in early 2019. Said minigame never came to light, so this street serves as a template street for anyone to use.

## How to modify

To edit this file, you must have a level editor, such as the [Open Level Editor](https://github.com/OpenToontownTools/OpenLevelEditor). Note: As of this time, it appears OTL can't open the street due to errors, however, a copy of the editor used by Disney opens with no issues.

## Real world uses
*Contact me if you want to be credited here - I'd love to see any implemenations of this street!* 

- An early (buggy) version of this street is currently in use in Tooniversal Studios, as a street from the Toon Estates.
