# Toontown Street


This is a DNA file of a Toontown Street.  This is for anyone who needs a street that is about 95% done (You can pick the names of buildings, billboards, and add addtional props.)  

## How to use

First, to edit this file, you must have the Toontown Level Editor.  If you want to just directly import this into Panda3D and edit it there, that can work as well, but the Toontown Level Editor is far more simpler and easier to use.
